# Diagnose Title Length

Flags a `Title` longer than 65 characters.

## Usage

``` r
lab_title_length(path = ".", verbose = TRUE, desc = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- path:

  Character. Path to the package directory. Default: `"."`.

- verbose:

  Logical. Print diagnostic output. Default: `TRUE`.

- desc:

  Optional pre-parsed `DESCRIPTION`, as returned by
  [`base::read.dcf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/dcf.html). Defaults to
  reading it from `path`.

## Value

[`checktor_check_result()`](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/checktor/reference/checktor_check_result.md)
with `passed`, `issues`, `message`.

## Source

*Writing R Extensions* §1.1.1 notes that some package listings may
truncate the title to 65 characters. That is a display width rather than
a limit, so a title of exactly 65 characters still shows in full and
only a longer one loses its tail. Nothing rejects a long title, which is
why this sits at `opinion` tier. See
[`vignette("check-sources", package = "checktor")`](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/checktor/articles/check-sources.md)
for how every check maps to its source.

[`checktor()`](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/checktor/reference/checktor.md),
which runs this and every other check.

## Examples

``` r
pkg <- example_diagnose_scenario("code_examples/tf_usage_bad.R",
                                 show_content = FALSE)
lab_title_length(pkg, verbose = FALSE)$passed
#> [1] TRUE
```
