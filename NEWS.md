# checktor 0.1.0

* Initial release.
* Adds [`checktor()`] as the top-level orchestrator, running five categories
  of diagnostics (code, DESCRIPTION, documentation, general, CRAN policy)
  against an R package directory.
* Adds the [`checkup()`] boolean wrapper for CI use, [`prescribe()`] for
  treatment recommendations, and [`health_report()`] for Markdown / HTML /
  text reports.
* All code-side diagnostics run XPath queries against the parsed AST via
  `xmlparsedata` + `xml2`. Documentation-side checks walk `.Rd` files via
  `tools::parse_Rd()`. DESCRIPTION is parsed with `base::read.dcf()`.
* Added result accessors so you no longer navigate nested lists: `issues()`
  (per-issue table), `tidy()` (per-check table), `summary()` (per-category),
  plus `passed()`, `is_healthy()`, `n_issues()`, `n_failed_checks()`, and
  `failed_checks()`. `as.data.frame()` on a result is equivalent to `tidy()`.
